Check it out, I made a web-app for bboys. http://bboytools.com/

It allows for you to have a move book with classifications/names/descriptions/youtube links. This way you can organize your moves and combos. There are also several tools built into the site based off of practice games I've picked up. Right now there are 3 tools.

1. 30/30 - This is essentially a stop watch that plays an airhorn every 30 seconds. It's useful for developing endurance. Practice hard for 30 seconds, then rest for 30 seconds.

2. Battle Mode - This shows all of your moves in their different categories. You can click on a move and select it as 'used'. It's then hidden. If you select all of the moves you did in a given round, the ones remaining are the moves you have left. By the time you get to the finals of a jam, you have a list of the moves you have left.

3. Move Call-Out - This will randomly cycle through all of your moves large on the screen and has text to speech so it will call out the name of the move through the speakers. This allows you to randomly chain moves together in combinations that you've never thought of before.

Right now it's in alpha and still pretty rough in some places.
